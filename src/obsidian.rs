// TODO: Implement Obsidian integration
// This started as a rough integration with Obsidian, but has grown complex enough to warrant splitting it
// into its own crate, obsidian-rs. Keeping this file in place, to serve as the integration with obsidian-rs,
// once it's ready to be used.

/// Add tests
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
}
